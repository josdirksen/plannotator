# @plannotator/ui

Plannotator's document UI — markdown rendering, themes, the annotation editor, settings, comments, and layout — as installable building blocks. Published so a separate app (the commercial Workspaces app) can reuse the exact same experience, while Plannotator itself stays unchanged.

Ships with **`@plannotator/core`**: a small, browser-safe, zero-dependency package of the pure utilities and types `ui` builds on (carved out so `ui` can be installed standalone without Plannotator's server code).

## Why this exists

Workspaces needs the same document experience Plannotator has — render docs, annotate, comment, theme, edit — but backed by its own infrastructure (its own storage, auth, realtime, AI). Rather than fork or rebuild, it **installs these packages and plugs in its own backend.** Plannotator passes nothing and behaves exactly as before.

## How it works: host-override seams

Every place the UI talks to a backend (loading a doc preview, saving settings, persisting drafts, streaming comments, listing files, calling AI, etc.) is an **optional seam** that defaults to Plannotator's behavior. A host swaps in its own implementations through **one call at startup**:

```ts
import { configurePlannotatorUI } from "@plannotator/ui/configure";

configurePlannotatorUI({
  storageBackend,              // where settings persist
  identityProvider,           // who the current user is
  imageSrcResolver,           // how image paths resolve to URLs
  docPreviewFetcher,
  fileTreeBackend,
  draftTransport,
  externalAnnotationTransport, // live/agent comments
  aiTransport,
  serverSync,
});
```

Anything you don't pass keeps Plannotator's default. A few component-specific overrides (e.g. an "open in editor" diff action) are passed as props where you render that component.

## Consuming it (e.g. from Workspaces)

```bash
npm install @plannotator/ui @plannotator/core
```

1. Call `configurePlannotatorUI({ ... })` once at startup with your backend.
2. Import the stylesheet: `import "@plannotator/ui/styles.css";` (precompiled — no Tailwind wiring needed; if you'd rather run your own Tailwind over the package source, add `@source` globs for `@plannotator/ui`'s `components/`, `hooks/`, and `utils/` dirs in your own CSS — the package doesn't ship its build entry).
3. **Load the fonts in your app entry** — the stylesheet references `--font-sans` / `--font-mono` but does not ship font binaries (standard for a shared UI package; your app owns font loading). Plannotator uses Inter + Geist Mono:
   ```ts
   import "@fontsource-variable/inter";
   import "@fontsource-variable/geist-mono";
   ```
   Or provide your own fonts and set `--font-sans` / `--font-mono` to match.
   The same policy covers math: KaTeX's stylesheet + fonts are deliberately not in `styles.css` — if you render math, load `katex/dist/katex.min.css` yourself (import, CDN tag, or self-hosted copy; see HANDOFF.md "Math rendering").
4. Import components: `import { Viewer } from "@plannotator/ui/components/Viewer";`
5. Build with a bundler that compiles TS/TSX (Vite + React 19 + Tailwind v4). The packages ship **source**, so your bundler compiles them — set `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, `allowImportingTsExtensions`, `jsx: "react-jsx"`.

## Packages & publishing

- `@plannotator/core` — pure utils + types, zero deps, browser-safe (CI enforces no `node:` imports). Published.
- `@plannotator/ui` — React components/hooks + theme + `configure()`. Depends on `@plannotator/core` (exact-version lockstep). Published.
- `@plannotator/shared`, `@plannotator/ai` — stay private to the monorepo; `shared` re-exports `core`'s modules via shims so Plannotator's internals are untouched.
- Versioned in lockstep with the repo. Publish `core` then `ui`: build each tarball with **`bun pm pack`** (resolves `workspace:*` to the exact version at pack time), then **`npm publish *.tgz --provenance --access public`** — the repo's existing flow.

## The one rule

**Do not reimplement the document UI from scratch.** A prior from-scratch rewrite broke the app and was reverted. The supported path is always: keep these components as-is and add a seam where a host needs different backend behavior. Never delete working Plannotator code until a human has confirmed parity in the browser.
