/**
 * React hook wrapping CollabRoomClient for editor/component consumption.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const room = useCollabRoom({ url, user, adminSecret? });
 *   room.addAnnotations([ann]);
 *
 * Effect deps: [url, adminSecret, user.id, enabled]. Change any and the hook
 * tears down the client and creates a new one. For stable connections, consumers
 * should memoize `user` (used by value) and avoid mutating `url`/`adminSecret`.
 *
 * Changes to user.name/color propagate via the next sendPresence() call without
 * reconnecting.
 *
 * === Key-gated client ===
 * The effect runs AFTER the render commits. So when url/adminSecret/user.id/
 * enabled change, React could otherwise return a render of the previous
 * authenticated state and old client before the effect fires. To prevent a
 * click in that window sending to the wrong room, every read (state +
 * requireClient) compares the CURRENT render's prop key against the key the
 * stored client was created for. Mismatch returns DISCONNECTED_STATE /
 * client: null / mutations throw unavailable-client.
 *
 * === Mutation contract (V1) ===
 * Mutation methods (`addAnnotations`, `updateAnnotation`, `removeAnnotations`,
 * `clearAnnotations`) resolve when the op is SENT to the server, not when
 * local state has been updated. The returned `annotations` array reflects
 * server-echoed state — awaiting `addAnnotations(...)` and then reading
 * `annotations` synchronously may still show pre-echo state.
 *
 * For reactive UI, render from the returned `annotations` field; it updates
 * via React state when the server echo arrives and is applied by the client.
 * This mirrors `CollabRoomClient`'s `state` event contract.
