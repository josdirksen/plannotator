#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Local manual E2E runner for Plannotator Live Rooms.
#
# Starts two long-running processes:
#   - apps/room-service via `bun run dev:room` (wrangler dev on :8787 by default).
#   - apps/hook via `bun run dev:hook` (Vite on :3000) with
#     VITE_ROOM_BASE_URL pointing at whichever room service the user
#     wants the editor's `createRoom()` to target.
#
# Default target: http://localhost:8787 (the local wrangler dev above).
# Use ROOM_PORT=8788 to run the local room service on a different port.
# Tunnel / staging: pass ROOM_BASE_URL=<url> — generated participant
# and admin links then carry that URL instead of localhost, so a
# second machine can actually reach the room.
#
#   ROOM_BASE_URL=https://your-tunnel.trycloudflare.com bun run dev:live-room
#
# Traps Ctrl-C / exit and tears down both child processes so a second
# run doesn't collide with orphaned wrangler or Vite instances.
#
# Iteration scope:
#   - Creator tab at :3000 uses Vite HMR — changes to App.tsx land live.
#   - Room tab served by the room service runs the built shell, so
#     changes to RoomApp / collab components need a manual
#     `bun run --cwd apps/room-service build:shell` + browser refresh.
#     Not auto-watched here on purpose.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS system Bash). `wait -n` is Bash 4.3+ and
# is NOT available on macOS, so this script polls both child PIDs in
# a loop with `kill -0` instead.
